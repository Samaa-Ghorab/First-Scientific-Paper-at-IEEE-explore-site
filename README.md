## Paper Title : Liver Disease Identification Based on Machine Learning Algorithms 
### Liver disease became a worldwide issue that is more required to be solve. Early detection of disease is extremely important for deriving the best treatment during the patient's treatment process and saving lives.In recent years, people try to find methods that could predict and identify nowadays diseases that people are suffering from. In other words, the need of controlling illnesses from spreading all over the world which cause in increasing in the number of deaths is pushing us towards finding best and effectively working methods to identify the disease earlier to manage it before severe symptoms occur to the patient. Luckily, Machine learning algorithms are the best solution for such cases, they are fast, effective, and accurate.

### This paper attempt to predict and identify liver disease using various Machine Learning (ML) techniques. These techniques include Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting (GB), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF). The evaluation results depend upon the accuracy values indicated that the results achieved are 76.07%, 74.36%, 71.79%, 70.09%, and 80.34% for LR, SVM, GB, DT, and RF, respectively.

### The system was put into action by assessing each phrase that was utilized. Determine if the patient has liver disease based on the medical reports. This phrase was utilized to lessen the workload for doctors. Please feel free to read and express your opinion https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10390061 .
